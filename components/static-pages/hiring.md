We are a remote-first team that loves distributed leadership and autonomy within collaboration around the world: Aix-en-Provence, Auckland, Brussels, Berlin, Guadalajara, New York, Madrid, Paris, Shropshire, Navi Mumbai, Vancouver and Wellington. This start-up culture is truly different – the culture is one of care, listening, rigor, and autonomy within collaboration. If you are used to cut-throat dynamics and all-nighters, you will be happy to find another world is possible, and it is amazing.

We are building and maintaining money management software for the commons.

<h2 id='software-engineer'>Senior Software Engineer</h2>

We are looking for a senior "full-stack" software engineer who’s excited about open source, making communities sustainable, and transparent finances.

### We think you’d be great at this if you:

- Are comfortable in a remote environment that is at the same time highly collaborative (we [apply](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/2267) a [seeking feedback process](https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/theory/decision-making/)) and autonomous (you can run a feature end to end on your own!)

- Are based within 6 hours of Central European Time:

  - to optimize timezone overlaps with the current engineering team (who are predominantly based in Europe)

- Have significant experience as a full stack engineer using JavaScript (<em>"senior"</em>)

- Are familiar with the technologies used in our two main projects:

  - our GraphQL API (powered by Node, PostgreSQL and Sequelize)
  - our Web App (powered by Next.js, React and Apollo).

- You are excited about our mission and share our philosophy.
